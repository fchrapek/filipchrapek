## The pain is real

I love working with tools that care about your progress and effectively preserve your work.

That's why when, after several hours of work and that wonderful feeling of accomplishment after finally getting that last tiny thing to work (the one that refused to cooperate no matter what), you lose all your progress because you forgot to hit that f#cking `cmd/ctrl + s`...

...you feel like writing the creators a personalized letter expressing your deep appreciation for such a thoughtful approach.

Yeah, I know. We all know this pain. And it's not just anecdotal - browsing the forums, this is a recurring problem.

n8n is great, but a feature that would make it even greater is automatic work saving.

## Why doesn't n8n have auto-save?

Digging deeper into why such an established tool with a huge community that has real influence on its development doesn't have this seemingly basic feature, you'll find some interesting arguments.

The community is divided. Here's a thoughtful response from a power user:

> To add to this conversation, autosave in n8n workflows would be detrimental to my workflow (pun intended). At least without some other features being released alongside it such as improved version history.
>
> In my opinion, there are some types of software where autosave can actually reduce productivity.
>
> While I understand the appeal, I don't think it's right for n8n. Making and editing workflows involves experimental changes and iterative testing, where the ability to revert to a known good state is crucial. With autosave, recovering from unsuccessful experiments would become much worse than dealing with occasional unsaved work.
>
> That's not even to mention the fact that if the workflow is enabled, you will be breaking the workflow.
>
> Even if you are using best practices like editing copies of a workflow or using an entirely different environment, being able to consciously save where you want to save progress is the most productive process, at least for me.

### The proper solution would require:

**Core features:**
- Draft mode to save workflows without affecting the enabled version (this is actually more of a priority than autosave)
- Enhanced version history feature with clearer change tracking (possibly AI-assisted descriptions)
- User choice to enable/disable autosave (both in UI and via ENV VARS)

**UI improvements:**
- Clear save status indicators (similar to Google Docs' "Saving…" and "Saved" states)

As the user points out:

> If you're not aware, this would require significant refactoring of n8n's core functionality. It's not just a simple feature toggle.

:::note[ ]
**The good news:** The n8n team is [aware of the issue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/3321) and community discussions are ongoing. But until an official solution arrives, we need workarounds.
:::

## What you can do right now

The great and active community comes to the rescue. Here are two solutions you can use today:

### Option 1: Browser Extension

A community member created a Chrome extension that adds auto-save functionality:

**[AutoSave8n Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/autosave8n/nieoihecpgapeodjpieehabgddjihegf?hl=en)**

This is the easiest solution if you're using Chrome or any Chromium-based browser (Edge, Brave, etc.). Just install it and forget about manual saving.

**How to install:**
1. Visit the [Chrome Web Store link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/autosave8n/nieoihecpgapeodjpieehabgddjihegf?hl=en)
2. Click "Add to Chrome"
3. The extension will automatically save your n8n workflows as you work

### Option 2: Userscript

For those who prefer more control or use different browsers, there's a userscript solution:

**[n8n-autosave-userscript on GitHub](https://github.com/cybertigro/n8n-autosave-userscript)**

This requires a userscript manager like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey, but gives you more flexibility to customize the behavior.

**How to install:**
1. Install a userscript manager:
   - **Chrome/Edge/Brave:** [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
   - **Firefox:** [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
   - **Safari:** [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/app/userscripts/id1463298887)
2. Visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cybertigro/n8n-autosave-userscript)
3. Click on the `.user.js` file and then "Raw"
4. Your userscript manager will prompt you to install it
5. Configure the autosave interval in the script settings if needed

## My take

Look, I get both sides of the argument. Power users who do complex workflow development need the ability to experiment without auto-committing every change. But for the majority of users, losing hours of work because of a closed laptop lid or browser crash is unacceptable in 2025.

The solution is obvious: **make it optional**. Give users a toggle in settings. Those who need manual control can disable it, and the rest of us can work without fear of losing everything.

Until n8n implements a proper solution with draft mode and version history, use one of the community workarounds above. Your future self will thank you when you don't lose 3 hours of work.

:::tip[ ]
**Pro tip:** Even with auto-save, get into the habit of hitting cmd/ctrl + s after completing a significant chunk of work. Old habits die hard, but they also save your ass.

## Summary

n8n is an incredible automation tool, but the lack of auto-save is a real pain point. The community has provided temporary solutions, and the developers are aware of the issue. 

For now:
1. Install the browser extension or userscript
2. Train yourself to save manually (muscle memory is your friend)
3. Consider using workflow copies for experimental changes
4. Wait for the official implementation with proper draft mode

Don't let a missing feature stop you from using n8n - it's still one of the best self-hosted automation tools out there.
